# Automatic_tagging_of_clothing_in_E-Commerce
The python files are for converting the data to different formats, the entire pipeline of which can be found at https://medium.com/@dataturks/automatic-tagging-of-clothing-in-e-commerce-using-tensorflow-and-gcp-d2b623cd2a78 . 
The Images folder here is only a sample of the entire data. As there were almost 500-600 images used the entire data cannot be uploaded. 
These can be downloaded from here or one can create there own dataset and proceed. I have tried to tag the images with one of the following tags: 
Jackets
Jeans
T-shirts
Shirts
Shoes
Sunglasses
Skirts
Trousers
Tops
